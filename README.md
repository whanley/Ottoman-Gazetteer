# Ottoman-Gazetteer
Materials for the production of a historical gazetteer of the Ottoman empire.

Initial aims:
- a vocabulary of Ottoman administrative units
- a linkable database of Ottoman provinces, subprovinces, major cities, and other generally-agreed geospatial objects

## Progress
- April 27, 2016: posted [tsv spreadsheet](https://github.com/whanley/Ottoman-Gazetteer/blob/master/data/Osmanli-yer-adlari.tsv) of 6411 adminsitrative units
- May 2016: many revisions and refinements to the spreadsheet
- June 2016: initial [rdf dump](https://github.com/whanley/Ottoman-Gazetteer/blob/master/data/ottgaz.ttl) of <1000 provinces, subprovinces, and some seats, as well as very preliminary outline of an [ontology](https://github.com/whanley/Ottoman-Gazetteer/tree/master/ontology).
