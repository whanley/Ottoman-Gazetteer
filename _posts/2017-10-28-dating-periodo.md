Change over time is a key challenge in conceptualizing any historical gazetteer. At this preliminary stage, the periodization requirements of the Ottoman gazetteer are relatively straightforward. I aim to represent the Ottoman administrations's understanding of the hierarchical organization of its territory units over the course of the empire's history. I do not seek to understand the duration and extent of Ottoman control in practice. I merely wish to record the approximate date on which each territorial unit was established _in the eyes of the administration_. I will assume that the unit remained valid until it was superseded by a new designation produced by the Ottoman administration. Thus the dataset is periodized using start dates, with end dates derived from the start date of any subsequent designation of the place in question.

Sezen's "[Osmanl覺 Yer Adlar覺](http://www.os-ar.com/osmanli_yer_isimleri.pdf)" contains dates of four types (all expressed in the Gregorian calendar):

1. Years
2. Approximate years (designated by a `~`)
3. Centuries (for instance, 16 yy.)
4. Ranges (typically with two years given, e.g. 1541-1686, but sometimes only a terminal year, e.g. "1926 y覺l覺na kadar"; sometimes the date range refers to a century rather than a year)

The dates are distributed in this manner:
